# Football Analyszer

Our system processes input football match videos using advanced computer vision techniques. We employ YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time detection of players, referees, and the ball. Subsequently, we utilize ByteTrack to track these detected objects across video frames, ensuring consistent identification throughout the match. The final output is a video that features bounding boxes around the detected objects, clearly distinguishing players, referees, and the ball. Additionally, we generate a dynamic minimap, similar to those seen in video games, providing a top-down view of the match progression. This comprehensive approach combines detection, tracking, and visualization to offer an enhanced football match analysis experience.
